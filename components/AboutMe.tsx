        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600 text-center">
          I am German and Luxembourgish but I was born and raised in Brussels. I
          was always passionate about science and technologies. I first wanted
          to become an astrophysicist so at school, I specialized in languages
          (French, English and German), but most importantly in physics and
          mathematics. When I graduated high school, I joined free University of
          Brussels (ULB) in the field of physics to follow my dream. I got to
          the second year and my passion for physics started to diminish, I
          however had a IT class where we discovered Python and I loved it.

          I then decided to make a full 180 and applied to the Karel de Grote
          Hogeschol (KdG). I moved to Antwerp and started a new life as a
          developer. Now I have finished my degree and I am still just as
          invested in IT as I was when I first discovered it. I am specialized
          in full-stack development but I have good knowledge of data and AI.
